title: Academic Background

My name is Tejas and I am a Data Science student at the University of British Columbia. I completed my undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Simon Fraser University, where I was involved in the Thewalt Biophysics lab. I analyzed biophysical properties of lipid membranes through the use of deuterium NMR. In one project, we assessed what happened to membranes when the concentration of ceramide, a lipid, was increased (the link to our publication can be found below). This was done to mimic apoptotic conditions in cells, which have been observed to have high quantities of this lipid. Interestingly, we found that ceramide made the membrane less fluid which agreed with the studies of our collaborators.
